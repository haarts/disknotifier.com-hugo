                A service which alerts you when you are about to run out of disk space.
                Thus preventing downtime and costing you stress and money.

                Disk Notifier isn't for you if you need a whole lot of cool looking graphs.
                We focus on the bare minimum.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Why did you start Disk Notifier?</h4>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">
                A project of mine to scratch my own itch.
                In my career as a software developer I've seen some nasty incidents where a server went down. It was always a full disk.
                This is easy to prevent in principle, it just never happens. As a developer you are always late or busy.
                Monitoring and let alone alerting is just not something you have time for.
                That's why Disk Notifier. Dead simple disk monitoring.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">What technology is Disk Notifier using?</h4>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">
                We are using a Rails backend with several, pardon the word, micro services. These are writting in Crystal.
                The static sales website is written with Hugo.
                Our database is the venerable Postgres and we use Redis as a message bus.
                The micro services run on a dedicated machine and the sales website runs on Netlify. The Rails backend runs on Render.com.
